# The Plan:

  1. One downloadable .zip file (probably from github 'releases' page)
      - contains all openpose code including models 
      - pyinstaller bundled version of our code and its corresponding deps

  2. Within the pyinstaller bundle (which is an .exe):
      - our code
      - python itself
      - all dependencies
